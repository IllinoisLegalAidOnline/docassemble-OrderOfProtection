  Order of Protection
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Order of Protection** Easy Form.

  This program makes forms that help you ask the court to order someone to stop harming or threatening you, your children, or other household members. The Order of Protection can also require the abuser to stay away from other protected people and locations.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**Orders of Protection**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/29806).
  
  #### Your safety is important
  
  * If you are in immediate danger, call 911.
  * If you need to exit this program, click the red **Escape** button at the top of the screen.

  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know: 

  * A safe mailing address where the court can contact you,
  * Information about people you want to protect,
  * Details about the abuser, including where they can be found,
  * Details about the abuse and when it happened,
  * What property and places you want to protect, and
  * Information about other court cases involving you and the abuser, if known.

  If you have children with the abuser, you also need to know:
  
  * School or daycare information, and
  * How you want the court to restrict parenting time, if any.

  Set aside 15 to 30 minutes to finish this program. You can login and save your work to continue later.

id: who can be protected
continue button field: who_can_be_protected
question: |
  Who can get an Order of Protection
subquestion: |
  You can ask for an Order of Protection if you have been abused by a current or ex-romantic partner or a family or household member, such as a:
  
  * Current or ex-spouse,
  * Person with whom you live or used to live,
  * Parent of your child,
  * Relative by blood,
  * Related through a current or a prior marriage,
  * Relative of your child (includes relatives of your foster child, adopted child or prospective adopted child, or relatives of a child for whom you are the legally-appointed guardian or legally-appointed custodian), or
  * Caregiver for persons with disabilities.

  You can also ask for an Order of Protection if you are filing for any person who has been abused by a family or household member, but is unable to file on their own. This could be a minor child or a person with disabilities.

  There are many kinds of abuse. To learn more, read ILAO's [**Domestic violence common questions**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/185806).
---
id: important op info
continue button field: important_op_info
question: |
  Things you should know
subquestion: |
  The person who caused the abuse is called the **Respondent**. In court, the judge will use this word to refer to the abuser. This program and the forms will do the same.

  **You will need to include an address where the Respondent can be found.** This is so the sheriff can deliver the court papers. Delivery of the court papers is called **service.** This might be where the Respondent lives, works, or a place where they stay. **Note: the Respondent will get a copy of all the court forms, except for the ones that are confidential like school or daycare location.**

  You will need to list an address on your court forms. **If you do not want the Respondent to know where you are staying, or if you do not have a home address, you can list a different safe mailing address where you will receive court documents.**

  **The Order of Protection is not valid until signed by a judge.** You must go to court, either in person or remotely, where a judge will decide whether or not to grant you an Order of Protection.
